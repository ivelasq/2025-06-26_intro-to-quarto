Quarto, an innovative, open-source scientific and technical publishing system, provides data practitioners with a better way to share results and insights: one that’s clear, reproducible, and tailored to your audience. Whether you’re creating reports, dashboards, or presentations, Quarto helps you tell a complete data story with transparency and impact.",

Let’s break this down: Open-source: Posit believes that it’s better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Free software means more reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and elimination of cost barriers. Scientific and technical: Scientific and technical means that Quarto has specific things for journal articles or scientific papers, like support for code execution, citations, footnotes, scientific markdown, equations, citations, crossrefs, so many things. Publishing system: Quarto is a tool for writing dynamic documents that combine code, output, and text. It can embed output from Python, R, Julia, and Observable. Quarto can be rendered to create high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more formats. Pandoc is the tool working behind the scenes to change Quarto documents to their finalized format. Quarto documents are authored with markdown, which is a plain text format. But Pandoc markdown is very rich and lets you control your document in very specific ways while being easy to read and write."

Like mentioned earlier, Quarto was built from the start to support multiple computational systems and ecosystems. You can create presentations, books, websites, and so on after installing Quarto, you do not have to install other tools to create different things. Consistent expression for core features means that regardless of whether you are making a presentation, book, or website, the syntax is written same way. And for things that aren’t part of base Quarto, there are extensions that can add further functionality. Single-source publishing, you often need to create all sorts of output, like things that are printed, on the web, on the mobile. The idea is to being able to make publications from one source. And the Quarto team thinks deeply about accessibility and how to have Quarto default to meet accessibility guidelines."

There’s a software engineering concept called the DRY Principle (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”) that is useful in data work that encourages writing code that can be reused with functions or loops instead of copy/paste. Use variables (parameters) to dynamically change parts of your analysis or report like to generate the same report for different regions, departments, or time periods, write reusable functions to avoid repeating code and keeps work cleaner, more consistent, and easier to maintain. The folks at United States Geological Survey have great blog posts on how they are implementing these ideas in Quarto."

It takes many minutes to load so please open it up as soon as you can if you’d like to go this route. The packages will not come preinstalled, but the instructions are on the website. Finally, you can always install Positron, RStudio, or VS Code locally, but you will also need R or Python installed. You’ll also have to install the packages and download the repo materials.

    "text": "Set Up Instructions\nTo follow along with the workshop exercises, you’ll need Quarto version 1.7+ and access to a code editor that supports R or Python.\nWhile Quarto itself doesn’t require a programming language, the exercises will include code chunks in R or Python. If you don’t already have R or Python set up locally, I recommend using a cloud-based option like Posit Cloud (for R) or GitHub Codespaces (for Python). I will delete the Posit Cloud project in a few days, so please make a copy of your materials if you would like to keep them.\n\nRecommended Setup Options\nOption 1: Posit Cloud (RStudio in the cloud)\n\nCreate a free account at https://posit.cloud\nOpen the Posit Cloud project link: https://posit.cloud/content/10523289\nTo save a copy of the project to your workspace, click “Save a permanent copy”\n\nOption 2: GitHub Codespaces (VS Code in the browser)\n\nRequires a free account at https://github.com/\nGo to the GitHub repo: https://github.com/ivelasq/gasp2025-quarto-codespace\nClick “Use this template” then “Open in a codespace”\n\nPlease note that loading the codespace will take a few minutes.\nIf you are asked to install an extension called markdownlit, say “yes” and trust the publisher.\n\nYou will need to following the “Install the Necessary Packages” instructions below.\n\nOption 3: Local Installation\nChoose one editor and follow the steps:\n\nPositronRStudioVS Code\n\n\n\nDownload and install Positron: https://positron.posit.co/download.html\nQuarto comes pre-installed\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/downloads/\n\nMake sure RStudio is version 2022.07+\n\nQuarto comes pre-installed\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download\nDownload and install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\nInstall the following extensions:\n\nQuarto Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto\nJupyter Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the Workshop Materials\nIf you are using a cloud-based option, the files will be included in the project folder.\nIf you are not using a cloud-based option:\nIf you use Git/GitHub:\n\nClone the repository with Git:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/ivelasq/gasp2025-quarto-exercises.git\nIf you don’t use Git/GitHub:\n\nGo to the GitHub repo: https://github.com/ivelasq/gasp2025-quarto-exercises\nClick the green “Code” button → “Download ZIP”\nUnzip the folder and open it in your chosen editor\n\n\n\nInstall the Necessary Packages\n\nRPython\n\n\nIf you are using Posit Cloud, the packages will be pre-installed.\ninstall.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(c(\"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\", \"here\", \"janitor\", \"knitr\", \"readr\", \"scales\"))\n\n\n\nCreate your virtual environment by selecting Python: Create Environment in the Command Palette\nSelect your environment type (recommend Venv)\nChoose an interpreter path\nSelect requirements.txt check box to install dependencies",

Quarto projects also include a _quarto.yml configuration file so that every document in the project inherits the metadata in that file.

The freeze option specifies if computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or only be re-rendered when their source file changes. Freeze can used when you have either a large number of collaborators or many computational documents created over a long period of time. In these cases, it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have environment-specific requirements or one of your teammates wrote something in Python, which you don’t have installed. Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site."
