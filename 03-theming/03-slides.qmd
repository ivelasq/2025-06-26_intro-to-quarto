## How to Apply HTML Theming

Provide the custom theme under `theme` in the YAML heading:

````{.markdown filename="my-document.qmd"}
---
theme:
  - flatly
---
````

## However, we usually want to use our organization's theme

![](../images/flyer.png){fig-align="center" width="40%" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); border-radius: 5px;"}

## Introducing brand.yml

![](../images/brand-yml.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Create reports, apps, dashboards, plots and more that match your company’s brand guidelines with a single `_brand.yml` file.

:::
::: notes
brand.yml is a simple, portable YAML file that codifies your company’s brand guidelines into a format that can be used by Quarto, Python and R tooling to create branded outputs. Our goal is to support unified, branded theming for all of Posit’s open source tools—from web applications to printed reports to dashboards and presentations—with a consistent look and feel.

## brand.yml elements

* `meta`: Identifying information, name of the company, URLs, etc.
* `logo`: Files or links to the brand’s logos.
* `color`: Colors in the brand's color palette. 
* `typography`: Fonts for different elements. 
* `defaults`: Additional context-specific settings.

## How to apply brand.yml automatically

1. Define branding in a single` _brand.yml` file.
2. Save in the root directory of your Quarto project (alongside `_quarto.yml`)

Quarto will detect the presence of `_brand.yml` and automatically apply the brand to all documents of the supported formats in the project.

## Specify light and dark themes

You can now specify a light and dark brand. For example, at a project-level you can provide two brand files:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
brand:
  light: light-brand.yml
  dark: dark-brand.yml
```

## Your turn {background-color='{{< brand color pink >}}'}

{{< include 03-exercise.qmd >}}

```{r}
#| label: brand-clock
#| echo: false
# 5 minutes, warning at 1 minute
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0, play_sound = TRUE, warn_when = 1 * 60)
```
