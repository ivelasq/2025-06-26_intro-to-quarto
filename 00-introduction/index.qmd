### Why is it called Quarto?

According to the website, the developers wanted to use a name that had meaning in the history of publishing and ultimately landed on Quarto. A quarto is an 8-page double-sided booklet, made by folding a single sheet of paper into four sections.

> Quarto is the format of a book or pamphlet produced from full sheets printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves.
