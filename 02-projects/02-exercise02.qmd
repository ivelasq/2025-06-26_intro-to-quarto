* Add `final-py.qmd` or `final-r.qmd` under `Home` and give it the text `Report`:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
navbar:
  left:
    - href: index.qmd
      text: Home
    - href: final-r.qmd
      text: Report
```

* Open `about.qmd` and add some information about yourself. Feel free to edit the YAML.
* Render the project, then explore your new website!
