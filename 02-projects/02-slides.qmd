## Quarto projects

Quarto projects are directories that provide:

::: incremental

* A way to render all or some of the files in a directory with a single command (e.g. `quarto render myproject`).
* A way to share YAML configuration across multiple documents.
* The ability to redirect output artifacts to another directory.
* The ability to freeze rendered output (i.e. don’t re-execute documents unless they have changed).

## Freeze

You can use the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:

``` {.yaml .fragment filename="_quarto.yml"}
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

<br>

``` {.yaml .fragment filename="_quarto.yml"}
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```
